<h3 id="aboutApp">About HouseCat:</h3>
	<p>HouseCat is used to maintain an inventory of your valuables to be used in the case of a loss. If you suffer a loss, it will enable you to quickly provide a report to your insurance agent detailing the items lost, as well as their estimated value.
	
	<p>To get the best use out of this app, make sure to enter the information for your valuables as soon as you purchase them.
	
	<p>In the event of a loss, simply click on the Claim button to generate a claim report. You can then either print the report out or email it directly to your insurance agent.
		
	<p>Where did the name come from? 'HouseCat' is a concatenation of House and Catalog.
